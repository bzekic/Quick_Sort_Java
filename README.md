**Read Me for Quick Sorter**

This Quick Sort was created that will sort an unsorted array which uses the divide and conquer algorithm.

The way the Quick Sort uses divide and conquer is different from how the Merge Sort does. In the Merge Sort, the divide step does hardly anything, and all the real work happens in the combine step. Quick Sort is the opposite: all the real work happens in the divide step. The combine step in Quick Sort does nothing.

The Quick Sort sorts everything before it gets to the combine stage as it uses pivots. When it divides the array, all values to the left side of the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot and are sorted. All the values to the right side of the pivot are greater than the pivot and are sorted.
